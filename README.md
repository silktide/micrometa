## Documentation

Please find the [project documentation](doc/index.md) in the `doc` directory. We recommend [reading it](http://jkphl-micrometa.readthedocs.io/) via *Read the Docs*.

## Installation

This library requires PHP >=5.6 or later. I recommend using the latest available version of PHP as a matter of principle. It has no userland dependencies. It's installable and autoloadable via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) as [jkphl/micrometa](https://packagist.org/packages/jkphl/micrometa).
        
```bash
composer require jkphl/micrometa
```

Alternatively, [download a release](https://github.com/jkphl/micrometa/releases) or clone this repository, then require or include its [`autoload.php`](autoload.php) file.

## Dependencies

![Composer dependency graph](https://rawgit.com/jkphl/micrometa/master/doc/dependencies.svg)

## Quality

To run the unit tests at the command line, issue `composer install` and then `phpunit` at the package root. This requires [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to be available as `composer`, and [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/manual/) to be available as `phpunit`.

This library attempts to comply with [PSR-1][], [PSR-2][], and [PSR-4][]. If you notice compliance oversights, please send a patch via pull request.
